        extended model declarations (may not in practice be used, but 
        retained for backwards compatibility).

        will be incremented by one for each revision of the DTD that is publicly 
        released, however minor. Revision numbers will be kept in step on both this

        enable a version of the DTD to be generated that contains all Groups and 
        SuperGroups declared as elements instead of simply as parameter entities

     1. Content model of %MediaFile; changed to make element 
        %MediaFileFormatType; optional

Two versions of the DTD are available, one defining meaningful 
English-language names - the reference names - and the other defining 
short tags - four character alphanumerics which, although they carried 
some significance in the first ONIX releases, should now be regarded as 
arbitrary.  The appropriate version of the DTD must be referenced in the 
document type declaration included at the start of each ONIX message.

Both versions of the DTD include both reference and short tag names as 
fixed attributes of each element type, to aid conversion between the two 
versions and for compatibility with previous releases.

Neither version has in the past been recommended in preference to the 
other.  Initially, a majority of ONIX implementations seem to have used 
the short tags.  It is noticeable, however, that as ONIX moves into new 
areas of application, and as XML itself becomes more widely used and 
accepted, more implementors are choosing the reference names, to the 
point that some have questioned the desirability of maintaining the 
short tags.

There is no possibility that the short tags could be withdrawn from ONIX 
for Books in the near-term, or in any event without full consultation 
with ONIX national groups and the ONIX International Steering Committee. 
However, it is possible that some new ONIX applications (eg for Serials) 
may use reference names only; and the ONIX support team would encourage 
new implementors of any ONIX format to use reference names unless they 
have a strong reason for doing otherwise.
