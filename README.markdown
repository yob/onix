== ONIX

The ONIX standard is a somewhat verbose XML format that is rapidly becoming the
industry standard for electronic data sharing in the book and publishing
industries.

This library provides a slim layer over the format and simplifies both reading
and writing ONIX files in your ruby applications.

This replaces the obsolete rbook-onix gem that was spectacular in its crapness.
Let us never speak of it again.

== Installation

    gem install onix
